Zephyr
======

Zephyr is a popular, security-oriented RTOS governed the Zephyr Project, part of the Linux Foundation.
The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained and embedded systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated embedded controllers, smart watches, and IoT wireless applications.

Currently supported RISC-V boards include:

* `SiFive HiFive1 <zephyr-hifive1>`_
* Microsemi's Mi-V soft CPU running on the M2GL025 development board
* soft Pulpino CPU running on a Zedboard

There is also a generic `QEMU 32-bit RISC-V target <zephyr-qemu>`_.

For a full list and details, see `the Zephyr documentation <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/riscv32/index.html>`_.

Why Zephyr?
-----------

Zaphyr is a generic, open source, cross-platform and vendor-independent RTOS, with a well-constructed governance structure and extensive and active community.
Just like RISC-V, it has security and flexibility in mind, and comes with 'batteries included', enabling a wide array of applications thanks to a number of different configurations available.

Zephyr follows standard coding guidelines, best practices - shared with the wider Linux ecosystem and based on lessons learned from over 25 years of OS development - and a community approach for which it is especially praised.
