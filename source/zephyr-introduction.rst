Zephyr
======

Zephyr is a popular, security-oriented RTOS governed by the Linux Foundation.
The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained and embedded systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated embedded controllers, smart watches, and IoT wireless applications.

Currently supported RISC-V boards include the HiFive1, Microsemi's Mi-V soft CPU running on the M2GL025 development board, and a soft Pulpino CPU running on a Zedboard.

For a full list, see `the Zephyr documentation <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/riscv32/index.html>`_.
